## General Information
- This project aims to build a CNN-based model to accurately detect melanoma from images of skin lesions.
- Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- The project addresses the critical need for automated melanoma detection, which can significantly reduce the manual effort required by dermatologists in diagnosis.
- By developing a solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma, we can potentially improve early detection rates and save lives.
- The dataset used is from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), containing images of various skin cancer types, including melanoma.

## Conclusions
- The model achieved a high accuracy of 90% on the validation set after addressing class imbalance.
- Data augmentation techniques, particularly rotation, significantly improved the model's performance.
- The class re-balancing strategy effectively resolved the initial underfitting problem.
- The model shows good generalization, with similar training and validation accuracies.
